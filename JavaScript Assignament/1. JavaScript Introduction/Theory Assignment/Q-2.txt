Question 2: How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java?

ans :- 
    JavaScript is mainly used for making websites interactive and runs in browsers, while Python 
    is great for data science and automation, and Java is used for building large-scale 
    applications. JavaScript is loosely typed and dynamic, unlike Java’s strict typing and 
    Python’s clean syntax. It’s the only language that works natively in web browsers, making 
    it essential for front-end development.
