Question 3: Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript
file to an HTML document?

ans :- 
    The <script> tag in HTML is used to embed or reference JavaScript code within a webpage. It
    allows developers to add dynamic behavior, interactivity, and logic to their sites—like 
    responding to user actions, validating forms, or updating content without reloading the 
    page. You can place the <script> tag in the end of the <body> section, depending on when 
    you want the script to run.
