Question 1: What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development.

ans :- 
    JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is mainly used to make 
    web pages interactive, dynamic, and responsive.

    Key Roles of JavaScript :-
        1. Add Interactivity :-
            JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages — for example, showing alerts, 
            validating forms, creating sliders, or handling button clicks.

        2. Manipulates Web Content (DOM) :-
            It can dynamically change HTML and CSS — such as updating text, changing colors, or 
            hiding elements — without reloading the page.

        3. Handles User Input and Validation :-
            JavaScript can check if form inputs are correct before sending data to the server 
            (e.g., checking if an email field is empty).

        4. Communicates with Servers (AJAX / APIs) :-
            JavaScript can fetch or send data to servers without reloading the page — creating 
            a smoother user experience.
        
        5. Supports Backend Development :-
            With Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server side, making it a 
            full-stack language.
