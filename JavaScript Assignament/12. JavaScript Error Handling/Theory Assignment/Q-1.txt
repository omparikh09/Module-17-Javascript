Question 1: What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally
blockswith an example.

ans :-
    Error handling in JavaScript is the process of detecting and responding to errors that 
    occur while a program is running.

    1. try block :-
        -> Code that may produce an error is written inside the try block.
        -> JavaScript tries to run this code.

    2. catch block
        -> If an error occurs in the try block, the catch block runs.
        -> It handles the error without stopping the whole program.

    3. finally block (optional)
        -> Runs whether an error occurs or not.
        -> Used for cleanup tasks (closing connections, resetting values, etc.).
