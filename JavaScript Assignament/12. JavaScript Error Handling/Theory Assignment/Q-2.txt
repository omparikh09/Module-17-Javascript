Question 2: Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?

ans :-
    Error handling is important because it helps keep applications stable, user-friendly, and 
    secure.
    
    Without proper error handling, even a small mistake can cause the entire program to crash.

    1. Prevents Application Crashes :-
        -> Errors can stop JavaScript execution.
        -> Handling them ensures the app continues running smoothly.

    2. Improves User Experience :-
        -> Instead of showing confusing error messages or a blank screen, you can display friendly 
        messages to the user.

    3. Helps Debugging :-
        Error handling allows developers to:
            -> Log detailed error messages
            -> Identify where and why errors occur
            -> Fix issues faster

    4. Maintains Application Flow
        -> Even if something goes wrong, the program can still continue executing important code 
        (like saving data or redirecting users).

    5. Ensures Data Safety
        -> Proper error handling prevents actions that might corrupt or lose data when an error 
        occurs.

    6. Makes the Application More Reliable
        -> A well-handled error system improves overall software quality and reduces unexpected 
        behavior.
