Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a
switch statement instead of if-else?

ans :- 
    A switch statement in JavaScript is used to execute different block of code based on the 
    value of a variable or expression.

    -> Instead of writing multiple if-else conditions, a switch makes the code cleaner and 
    easier to read, especially when checking many possible values.

    -> How it works :-
        -> The value inside switch() is evaluated once.
        -> JavaScript compares it with each case.
        -> If a match is found, the code under that case runs.
        -> The break statement stops further case checking.
        -> If no case matches, the default block runs.
