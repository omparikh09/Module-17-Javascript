Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work with an
example.

ans :- 
    1. Control Flow :-
        Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the JavaScript code is executed.
        By default, JavaScript runs code from top to bottom, line by line, but using control 
        flow statements.

    2. if-else Statements :-
        if-else statements allow JavaScript to make decisions.
            -> The if block runs only if the condition is true.
            -> The else block runs only when if the condition is false.
            -> Optional else if can be used to check multiple condition.

        Example :-
            let age = 18;

            if (age >= 18) 
            {
                console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
            } 
            else 
            {
                console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
            }
