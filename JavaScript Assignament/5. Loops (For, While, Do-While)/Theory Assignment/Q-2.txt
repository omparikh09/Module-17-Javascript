Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

ans :-
    While Loop :-
        Condition checked first :- 
            The loop evaluates the condition before executing the body.
        
        Execution guarantee :- 
            If the condition is false at the start, the loop body may never run.
    
    Do While Loop :-
        Condition checked after :- 
            The loop executes the body once, then checks the condition.

        Execution guarantee :- 
            The loop body runs at least once, regardless of the condition.
