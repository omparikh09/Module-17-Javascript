Q-1. Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). 
Provide a basic example of each.

ans :- 
    1. for Loop :-
        -> Used when you know exactly how many times you want to run the loop.

        Example :-
            for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
            {
                console.log("For Loop Count:", i);
            }

    2. while Loop :-
        -> Used when you don’t know how many times the loop will run, but you have a condition 
        to check before each iteration.

        Example :-
            let i = 1;

            while (i <= 5) {
                console.log("While Loop Count:", i);
                i++;
            }

    3. do-while Loop :-
        -> Similar to while, but it executes the code at least once, even if the condition is 
        false.

        Example :-
            let i=1;
            do
            {
                console.log("While Loop Count:", i);
                i++;
            }while(i <= 5)
