Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?

ans :-
    1. Function Declaration :-
        -> A function declared using the function keyword with a name.
        -> It means the function can be called before it is defined in the code.

    2. Function Expression :-
        -> A function assigned to a variable. It may be named or anonymous, but most commonly 
            anonymous.
        -> You cannot call it before the line where it is defined.
