Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript
interact with the DOM?

ans :- 
    1. The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface provided by the browser that 
    represents a webpage as a tree-like structure of objects.

    -> Every element in the HTML (like <h1>, <p>, <div>, <button>) becomes a node or object in 
    the DOM.

    -> JavaScript can use this structure to access, modify, add, or delete elements on the 
    webpage.

    2. JavaScript interacts with the DOM using various methods and properties to change.

        1. HTML Content :-
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello!";

        2. CSS Content :- 
            document.querySelector('p').style.color = "red";
