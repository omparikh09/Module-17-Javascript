Question 2: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

ans :- 
    1. == :-
        -> Compares Only values, Not compare data types.
        -> If the types are different, JavaScript will convert the values before comparing.

    2. === :-
        -> Compares both values and data types.
        -> No type conversion happens.
