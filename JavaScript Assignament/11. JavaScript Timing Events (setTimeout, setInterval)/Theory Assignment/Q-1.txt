Question 1: Explain the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript. How are
theyused for timing events?

ans :- 
    1. setTimeout() :-
        -> Runs a function once after a specified time delay.

        Explanation :-
            -> The message prints only one time
            -> After 3000 ms (3 seconds)

        setTimeout() Uses :-
            -> Show a message after some time
            -> Delay animations
            -> Run code with a delay
            -> Display notifications after a timeout

    2. setInterval() :-
        -> Runs a function repeatedly after a fixed time interval.

        Explanation:
            -> The function keeps running every 2 seconds
            -> Continues until stopped with clearInterval()

        setInterval() Uses :-
            -> Updating a clock every second
            -> Automatically refreshing data
            -> Running repeated animations
            -> Creating timers and countdowns
