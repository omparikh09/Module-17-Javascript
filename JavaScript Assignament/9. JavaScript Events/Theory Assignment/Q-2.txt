Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide anexample.

ans :-
    The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler to an element without 
    overwriting existing event handlers.

    -> Listen for a specific event
    -> Run a function when the event happens
    -> Attach multiple events to the same element
    -> Separate HTML from JavaScript (clean code)
